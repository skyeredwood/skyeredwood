## ðŸŒ¸ Hello, I'm Skye (aka skye_exe or skylarexe)!
- I'm a full stack developer & pixel artist who's done just about everything - proficient in Java, Kotlin, C#, JavaScript/TypeScript and more. Most of my work is based around **Minecraft**. <br />
- I work most commonly with bumpyEvents, but previous roles have included BlockWars, EVNTGames/MoonrockLabs, Tiny Embers and more. In these roles I've worked with clients like **Mountain Dew**, **Princess Cruises** and **Twitch Rivals**. <br />
- In my spare time, I write and record music. I'm also training to be a theatre sound technician, and love exploring programming language design as a hobby! <br />
